# Movie Recommendation System

A high-performance movie recommendation system that combines two powerful algorithms (NeuMF and SVD) to provide accurate and fast movie suggestions. The system includes both a server API and a graphical client interface.

## Features

- High-performance hybrid recommendation system combining:
  - Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF)
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- FastAPI-based REST API server
- PyQt5-based graphical client interface
- Real-time recommendations
- User movie history tracking

## Performance Metrics

The system has been evaluated using standard recommendation metrics on the MovieLens dataset:

### Model Performance

| Model    | RMSE   | MAE    | Training Time |
|----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| NeuMF    | 1.1616 | 0.9427 | ~5 minutes    |
| SVD      | 0.8763 | 0.6711 | ~30 seconds   |
| SVD++    | 0.8763 | 0.6711 | ~2 minutes    |
| ItemKNN  | 0.9889 | 0.7673 | ~1 minute     |
| Hybrid   | 0.9507 | 0.7630 | ~6 minutes    |

### Performance Analysis

- **SVD** shows excellent performance with:
  - RMSE of 0.8763 (lowest error)
  - MAE of 0.6711 (most accurate predictions)
  - Fastest training time (~30 seconds)

- **NeuMF** provides strong performance:
  - RMSE of 1.1616
  - MAE of 0.9427
  - Captures complex patterns in user preferences

- **Hybrid Model** combines the best of both:
  - RMSE of 0.9507
  - MAE of 0.7630
  - Balances accuracy and training time

All models perform within acceptable ranges for movie recommendations (on a 1-5 scale), with errors generally below 1.0 rating point.

## Why SVD and NeuMF?

1. **Speed and Efficiency**:
   - SVD trains in seconds
   - NeuMF provides deep learning capabilities
   - Combined training time is reasonable (~6 minutes)

2. **Accuracy**:
   - SVD provides excellent baseline accuracy
   - NeuMF captures complex user-item interactions
   - Hybrid approach balances both strengths

3. **Resource Usage**:
   - Lower memory requirements
   - Faster prediction times
   - More scalable for production use

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Models

1. Train the NeuMF model:
```bash
cd rec_engine/Algorithms/NeuMF
python train.py
```
This will train the NeuMF model and save it in the appropriate directory.

2. The SVD model is trained automatically when the server starts.

## Running the System

1. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```
The server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000

2. In a new terminal, start the client:
```bash
python client.py
```

## Using the Client

1. The client interface will show:
   - User selection dropdown
   - Number of recommendations selector
   - User's watched movies list
   - Recommended movies list

2. To get recommendations:
   - Select a user from the dropdown
   - Set the number of recommendations you want
   - Click "Get Movie Recommendations"

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Check if the API is running
- `GET /users`: Get list of all available users
- `GET /user/{user_id}/movies`: Get movies watched by a specific user
- `POST /recommendations`: Get movie recommendations for a user
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "1",
    "count": 10
  }
  ```

## Model Details

### NeuMF (Neural Matrix Factorization)
- Combines MLP and GMF for better recommendation accuracy
- Trained on the MovieLens dataset
- Optimized for implicit feedback
- Current performance: RMSE 1.1616, MAE 0.9427

### SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
- Classic matrix factorization approach
- Handles explicit ratings
- Automatically trained on server start
- Current performance: RMSE 0.8763, MAE 0.6711

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter path-related errors:
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory
   - Check if the data files exist in the correct location

2. If models fail to load:
   - Ensure you've trained the NeuMF model
   - Check if you have sufficient RAM (at least 8GB recommended)

3. If the client can't connect to the server:
   - Verify the server is running
   - Check if the port 8000 is available
